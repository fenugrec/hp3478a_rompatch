Utilities and code for patching HP3478A firmware.

Experimental, not for general consumption

# utilities
* ckfix
Fix checksum by adjusting last byte.

# ROM patches
These apply on the dc118 ROM version.

* 01_ADtest
patch to bypass "AD TEST" self test. 

* 02_ADcomms
neutralizes comms to skip "AD LINK" self test, and pretend the ADC reads 0 in normal operations.

# Applying ROM patches
To apply patches, srecord is needed.

Example to apply one single patch "01_ADtest" to the original dc118 ROM dump:

`srec_cat ../dc118.bin -bin 01_ADtest.hex -intel -contradictory-bytes=ignore -redundant-bytes=ignore -o patched.bin -bin`
Then, running ckfix to fix checksums:
`ckfix patched.bin patched_fixed.bin`

# Verifying ROM patches
`srec_cmp ../dc118.bin -bin patched.bin -bin -v`
