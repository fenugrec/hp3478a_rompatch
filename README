Utilities and code for patching HP3478A firmware.

Experimental, not for general consumption

# utilities
* ckfix
Fix checksum by adjusting last byte.

# ROM patches
These apply on the dc118 ROM version. Most of them are for development use, in particular for testing the ROM under MAME emulation.
Running `make` should produce proper .hex files for each patch, and .crk files in crk_patches/.

Note : applying multiple patches requires fixing the checksum with `ckfix`.


* 01_ADtest
patch to bypass "AD TEST" self test.
Apply in first bank (offset 0)

* 02_ADcomms
neutralizes comms to skip "AD LINK" self test, and pretend the ADC reads 0 in normal operations.
Apply in first bank (offset 0)

* 03_ckdis
disable ROM checksum entirely. For development use only ! Patch must be applied at 0x1000 offset.

* 04_relmode
the most interesting one : implements "relative mode" to any (manual) range.
Pressing Shift then 4Wire saves and applies the current reading as an offset . There is an example ROM with this patch applied in patched_roms/


# Applying ROM patches
To apply patches, srecord is needed.
TODO : when patches apply in the upper 4kB bank (> 0x1000), the hex file needs to be offseted since the assembler doesn't know about the upper 4kB.

Example to apply one single patch "01_ADtest" to the original dc118 ROM dump, including checksum fix:

`./patchrom.sh ../dc118.bin 01_ADtest.hex 0 patched_01.bin`

or, manually :
`srec_cat ../dc118.bin -bin 01_ADtest.hex -intel -contradictory-bytes=warn -redundant-bytes=ignore -o patched.bin -bin`
(contradictory-bytes can also be set to ignore, but 'warn' allows to inspect and confirm the changes

Then, running ckfix to fix checksums:
`ckfix patched.bin patched_fixed.bin`

# Verifying ROM patches
`srec_cmp ../dc118.bin -bin patched.bin -bin -v`

To run in MAME : need to apply patches 01_ADtest and 02_ADcomms, otherwise emulation hangs at "AD LINK FAIL".
Then, `mame hp3478a` from the directory where rom_dc118.bin is stored (the builtin name for the default ROM).
